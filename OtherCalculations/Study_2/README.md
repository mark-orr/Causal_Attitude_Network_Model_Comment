README:

run_2b_graph_gen.py:
    Was used so that we could compute the empirical proportion of negative
    edges for a set of rewires.  The .wt files were outputs of this python
    file and we used the .wt files to compute the p. negative edges.
    
    
learning.py:
    Simulations 9-10, 11-12, 13-14 are the best ones.  Most fair.
    Built a S = {-1,1} version, Simulation 15 with random inputs as a 
    comparison, copied from 9-10 bc random inputs and Simulation 16 
    with ones input compied directely from Sim 15 and modded..
    
Network_Sim9-14.txt:
    This is the network structure for A-D sim sets used in final sims.
