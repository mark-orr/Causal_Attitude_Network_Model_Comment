README FOR /Users/biocomplexity/Projects/SocioCognitiveModeling/NSF-NetCogSys/Products/CAN_Model/CAN_GitRepo/IsingFitStudy/Hopfield/Simulations/run_1d_fix

The subdirectories listed here are direct copy from
     /project/biocomplexity/orr/Orr_CAN_scratch_8_30_21/.
     These were copied for analysis purposes for the final manuscript.

     Mods to the files are as follows:
         Within each subdirectory e.g. run_1d_fix_node-0/  the
	 file originally names <df_catch_endstate_analysis_out.csv>
	 is now tagged with the node number, e.g.,
	 <df_catch_endstate_analysis_out_0.csv> in the process of
	 copying to .../~/CAN_GitData/Hopfield/run_1d_fix-renames

    Also copied directly to .../~/CAN_GitData/Hopfield/run_1d_fix-renames 
    /project/biocomplexity/orr/Orr_CAN_scratch_8_30_21/run_1d/df_catch_endstate_analysis_out.csv
    for input to the run_1d analysis.

Analysis:
    The analysis hybridized the rivanna file:
        /project/biocomplexity/orr/Orr_CAN_scratch_8_30_21/run_1d_analysis_all/run_1d_analysis_all.py

    with the local file ../run_1b/run_1b_analysis_alt.py

    Both of these files are here copied and will not be modified here.

    The hybridized file will be called:
        ./run_1d_analysis.py

    Added the content in ./Graphs as copied from ../run_1b/  These
    are needed to run the analysis.
