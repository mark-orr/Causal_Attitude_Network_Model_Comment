The subdirectories listed here are direct copy from /project/biocomplexity/orr/Orr_CAN_scratch_8_30_21/. These were copied for analysis purposes for the final manuscript.

Mods to the files are as follows:
    Within each subdirectory e.g. run_1d_fix_node-0/  the file originally names <df_catch_endstate_analysis_out.csv> is now tagged with the node number, e.g., <df_catch_endstate_analysis_out_0.csv> in the process of copying to .../~/CAN_GitData/Hopfield/run_1d_fix-renames
