./Figure_Arch:
    THE FIGURES IN this folder are archives, used during development from March to Aug, 2021.

Analysis files:
    run_1b_analysis.py:  This was the original good analysis file, but does not have the better
    hamming based distribution analysis.
    
    run_1b_analysis_alt_dev.py:  The dev file for the final, better distribution analysis.
    
    run_1b_analysis_alt.py:  The final, cleaned file (based on run_1b_analysis_alt_dev.py).
