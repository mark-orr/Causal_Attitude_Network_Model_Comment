This file is for generating of the IsingFit network estimator.  The purpose
is to test the Reagan data in the Hopfield context.  This program will not
export data to R (e.g., an anti-ferrous magnet structure) but simply call the
R script to generate the IsingFit.

THERE IS SOME EXTRA STUFF IN HERE THAT IS VERY USEFUL:
    1. catch_endstate, shows that all patts in data converge to one attractor
    2. under #PLAYING WITH DATA U there is a nice analysis of the unique vectors in
    the reagan data
    3. The tests of sufficiencey show simple tests of any sin
